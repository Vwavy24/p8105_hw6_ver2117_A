\#Problem 2 \#Loading in Homicide Dataset

``` r
homi_df = read.csv("data/homicide-data1.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) 
```

\#Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homi_df = homi_df %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ",")) %>%
    select(-city, -state) %>%
  mutate(
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    disposition = sapply(disposition, switch,
                       "Closed without arrest" = 0,
                       "Open/No arrest" = 0,
                       "Closed by arrest" = 1)) %>%
  relocate(city_state, .after = victim_sex) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa,AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  select(city_state, disposition, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex)
```

\#For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply
the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence
interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
Bmore = homi_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD")

Bmo_log = glm(disposition ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
      data = Bmore, family = binomial())%>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), 
         CI_higher = exp(estimate +1.96 * std.error),
         CI_lower = exp(estimate -1.96 * std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

Bmo_log
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value | CI_higher | CI_lower |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|
| (Intercept)      |  0.310 | 1.363 |   0.070 |     1.907 |    0.975 |
| victim_age       | -0.007 | 0.993 |   0.043 |     1.000 |    0.987 |
| victim_raceWhite |  0.842 | 2.320 |   0.000 |     3.268 |    1.648 |
| victim_sexMale   | -0.854 | 0.426 |   0.000 |     0.558 |    0.325 |

\#Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
city_log = 
  homi_df %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~ glm(disposition ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = .x, family = binomial())), results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  select(results, city_state) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), 
         CI_higher = exp(estimate +1.96 * std.error),
         CI_lower = exp(estimate -1.96 * std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value, starts_with("CI"))
```

\#Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
city_log %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + geom_point() +geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_higher)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 80, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = "Plot of Estimated ORs and CIs for Each City", x = "City State", y = "Odds Ratio")
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_ver2117_A_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />
Looking at this plot is appears that, Albuquerque,NM has the highest
upper whisker and upper quartile of odds ratio while Chicago, IL has the
lowest. It is also interesting how the medians of ORs have been
relatively consistent throughout each citystate.

menarche, mheigth, momage, mrace, parity, pnumlbw, pnumgsa, ppbmi, ppwt,
smoken, wtgain.

### My regression model

For my regression model I selected these variables as well as the others
ones listed have a higher effect on a child’s birthweight. The variables
that I have chosen are: - mrace: Mother’s race - fincome: Family monthly
income - gaweeks: Gestational age in weeks - parity:Number of live
births prior to this pregnancy - wtgain: Mother’s weight gain during
pregnancy - bwt: Baby’s birth weight

According to Kelli Komro and her colleagues in the article:“Effects of
State-Level Earned Income Tax Credit Laws on Birth Outcomes by Race and
Ethnicity,” there has been a difference in factors that effect birth
weight. Factors that had a difference among races were the gestational
weeks, the family’s income, and the mother’s race which led me to
include those variables in my model. I also wanted to include the
variable parity and the mother’s weight gain during pregnancy to see if
those variables also made an impact on birth weight. The link to the
article is:

# Compare your model to two others: (1)One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only);(2)One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these.

``` r

mod_2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + babysex + blength + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*babysex*blength, data = birth_w)

    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",

  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>%

```

The plots that I made composing of all three models have shown that
Model Two is the best fit because it has the lowest RMSE compared to the
other two models. Model Two is composed of the head circumference,
length, sex, and all interactions. It seems as if my Model that I made
was not the best as it had the highest RMSE out of all three. :(
